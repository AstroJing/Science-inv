\section{Introduction}

It has believed that quasi-normal oscillations of neutron star carry important information about their structures. The quasi-normal mode of neutron star in general relativity were first studied by Kip Thorne $et~ al.$ \cite{Tho1968,Tho1,Tho3,Tho4,Tho1998} in late 60s. Recently Rosofsky $et~ al$. \cite{Shaw2019} use the numerical relativity simulations extract the f-mode oscillations and damping times. Since the perturbations can not evoke odd parity(axial), the mode we discussed are all polar mode and it has been divided into the fundamental mode, the pressure and the gravity modes by Cowling \cite{Cow1941}. Since the frequency of the f-mode is lower than other modes, the gravitational wave signal generated by f-mode is easier to detect. In the following content, we mainly discuss the detection of f-mode GW signals and the extraction of information from the f-mode GW signal. The  frequency of a typical neutron star f-mode is 1-3kHz and the damping time is 0.1-0.5s. Generally a f-mode GW signal can be generated in a supernova \cite{Pass2013}, starquake, and NS merger $et~ al$. There many ongoing and planned GW signal observations \cite{Aasi2015, Acer2015, Unni2013} $e.g.$, Advanced LIGO/Virgo, Eintein Telescope. 

The f-mode frequency of the binary neutron stars of GW170817 have been constrained by using a model for the GW signal that explicitly depends both on the tidal deform-ability and the f-mode frequency \cite{Prat2020} . In Ref. \cite{Prat2020} also point out that the network consisting of one Einstein Telescope and two Cosmic Explorer observatories shows great overall promise for enabling precision measurements of the binary parameters. Especially it can measure the f-mode frequencies within  1$\sigma$-errors. 

Recently, Wynn C. G Ho $et~ al.$ \cite{Wynn2020}  discussed the f-mode GW signals generated by the pulsar glitch and they claim that while the glitch size of most measured glitches and distance to each corresponding pulsar produce $h_0\sqrt{\tau_{gw}}<10^{-24}Hz^{-1/2}$, about $20\%$ of glitches would be strong enough to produce a GW signal can be observed by current and next generation detectors. 
%There are many studies on extracting the information of the EoS based on the f-mode signal\cite{Shaw2019}.

Isospin asymmetric nuclear matter is an important component of the neutron stars. However, the nature of asymmetric nuclear matter in high density is still unclear. Many researches hope to obtain information about the Equation of State(EoS) \cite{Latt2001, XWJ1, Watt2016}. There are many studies that have revealed the low density($\rho_0 \approx 2.8\times 10^{14}g/cm^3$) EoS of symmetric nuclear matter and the symmetry energy $E_{sym}(\rho)$. But the high density symmetry energy $E_{sym}(\rho)$ is still unknown. In fact, it is the most uncertain part of the EoS of dense neutron-rich nucleonic matter \cite{Bald2016}.  This great uncertainty of high-density nuclear symmetry energy is mainly due to our poor knowledge about the relatively weak isospin-dependence of the two-body force, the short distance spin-isospin dependence of the three-body force and tensor force at short distances in dense neutron-rich nuclear matter \cite{Li2019}. 

By using the Bayesian method the parameters of EoS can be expressed as a posterior  probability distribution function(PDF).

\begin{equation} \label{EQ1}
P(\mathcal{M}|D)=\frac{P(D|\mathcal{M})P(\mathcal{M})}{\int P(D|\mathcal{M})P(\mathbf{M})d\mathcal{M}}
\end{equation}

Where $P(\mathcal{M}|D)$ is conditional distribution it means the probability for the Model $\mathcal{M}$ given data D. In this work the model $\mathcal{M}$ represent the parameter EoS. And the data D are the observed f-mode frequency and damping time. Bayesian parameter inference is a commonly used method to extract neutron star information from gravitational wave signals. For example, the parameters in GW170817 are obtained by Bayesian inference \cite{Abbo2019}. Bayesian statistics provides a simple and unified method for all data analysis problems, allowing researchers to determine the probability of the model based on the observation results \cite{Greg2010}.

In this paper, we assume that the frequency and damping time of the f-mode can be observed within a certain accuracy range, and use the isospin-dependent parametric EoS as the input model, the prior parameters we use comes from the work of \cite{YXLI}. And we use the program used by Lin $et~ al.$ \cite{Lin2014} to calculate the theoretical f-mode frequency and damping time, and then we use Bayesian analysis to obtain the constraints on the symmetry energy and the parameters of EoS. We found that if the frequency measurement accuracy is one thousandth and the mass is known, 2 times the saturation density of nuclear and the parameter $K_{sym}$ can be  constrained very well and if the mass is unknown but the damping time can be measured within $1\%$ the 2 times the saturation density of nuclear and the parameter $K_{sym}$ can be also well constrained. This work established the method of using f-mode GW signal to directly extract the parameters of parametric EoS. 


The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. \uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral2}, We brief review  the isospin-dependent parametric EoS of dense neutron-rich nucleonic matter. We also give the prior EoS parameter ranges. In Sec. \uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral3}, we show the details of extracting the EoS parameters from the f-mode GW signals. We also present the results corresponding to different observations. In Sec. \uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral4}, a brief review of this paper.


\section{The isospin-dependent parametric EOS}

Here we give a brief outline of the isospin-dependent parametric EOS model,where the dense nuclear matter is supposed to be composed of neutrons, protons, electrons and muons at $\beta$-equilibrium and charge neutral \cite{ZNB 1,Xie2019}.

The specific energy of nucleon $E(\rho,\delta)$ for neutron-rich nuclear matter can be well approximated by the empirical parabolic law as \cite{Bombaci, Li}:
\begin{equation} \label{EQ1}
E(\rho,\delta)=E_0(\rho)+E_{sym}(\rho)\cdot\delta^2+O(\delta^4),
\end{equation}
where $\delta$, ${E_{0}(\rho)}$ and $E_{sym}(\rho)$ are isospin asymmetry $\delta=(\rho_n-\rho_p)/\rho$, the energy in symmetric nuclear matter and the symmetry energy of asymmetric nuclear matter, respectively. They can be parameterized by the following equations \cite{ZNB2018}
\begin{equation} \label{EQ2}
E_0(\rho)=E_0(\rho_0)+\frac{K_0}{2}(\frac{\rho-\rho_0}{3\rho_0})^2+\frac{J_0}{6}(\frac{\rho-\rho_0}{3\rho_0})^3,
\end{equation}

\begin{eqnarray} \label{EQ3}
E_{sym}(\rho)=E_{sym}(\rho_0)+L(\frac{\rho-\rho_0}{3\rho_0})+\frac{K_{sym}}{2}(\frac{\rho-\rho_0}{3\rho_0})^2+\frac{J_{sym}}{6}(\frac{\rho-\rho_0}{3\rho_0})^3,
\end{eqnarray}
where $\rho_{0}$ is the nuclear saturation density. According to the researches near nuclear saturation density, the most probable values of parameters in Eq. \ref{EQ2} and Eq. \ref{EQ3} are as follow: $K_{0}$ = 230 $\pm$ 20 MeV, $E_{sym}(\rho_{0})$ = 31.7 $\pm$ 3.2 MeV, $L$ = 58.7 $\pm$ 28.1 MeV, and $-$300 $\leq$ $J_{0}$ $\leq$ 400 MeV, $-$400 $\leq$ $K_{sym}$ $\leq$ 100 MeV, $-$200 $\leq$ $J_{sym}$ $\leq$ 800 MeV, see, e.g., Refs.\cite{Shlomo, Piekarewicz, Li 2, ZNB 2, Li 3, Oertel}. It is shown that the parameters $K_{0}$, $E_{sym}(\rho_{0})$ and $L$ have already been constrained in a very narrow range, while $J_{0}$, $K_{sym}$ and $J_{sym}$ have large uncertainties. To simplify the calculation, here we choose the most probable values for $K_{0}$, $E_{sym}(\rho_{0})$ and $L$ as $K_{0}$ = 230 MeV, $E_{sym}(\rho_{0})$ = 31.7 MeV and $L$ = 58.7 MeV. The  ranges of $J_{0}$, $K_{sym}$ and $J_{sym}$ we used is come from Ref. \cite{YXLI}.

It is worth noting that the above expressions  are Taylor expansions  near the saturation density for asymmetric nuclear matter, actually here they are simply parameterizations for very neutron-rich systems especially at supra-saturation densities. Therefore, the  parameters $ J_{0}, K_{\textrm{sym}}$ and $J_{\textrm{sym}}$ are no longer Taylor expansion coefficients at high-density, but free parameters to be determined by observations of neutron stars and/or high-energy heavy-ion reaction experiments \cite{ZNB2018}. Of course, these parameterizations become the Taylor expansions again when the density approaches the saturation  density. Compared  with the multisegment polytropic EOSs, above parametric EOS model builds  a more convenient way to extract the symmetric energy of the asymmetric nuclear matter from the astronomical observations.

The core matter of neutron star is described by above parametric EOS model. In addition, the inner crust and the outer crust is described by the NV EOS \cite{Nege1973} and BPS EOS \cite{Baym1971b}, the crust-core transition point is obtained by thermodynamical approach \cite{Kubi2004, Kubi2007}. We choose resolution for EOS tables as  Ref. \cite{chen}.

%Where $rho_{0}$ is the nuclear saturation density. $\delta$ is isospin asymmetry and $\delta=(\rho_n-\rho_p)/\rho$,  ${E_{0}(\rho)}$ and $E_{sym}(\rho)$ are the energy in symmetric nuclear matter at density $\rho$ and the symmetry energy of asymmetric nuclear matter at density $\rho$.   The heavy ion collision experiment and some astronomical observations give the most probable distribution of these parameters: $K_{0}$ = 230 $\pm$ 20 MeV, $E_{sym}(\rho_0)$ = 31.7 $\pm$ 3.2 MeV, $L$ = 58.7 $\pm$ 28.1 MeV, and $-300 \leq J_{0} \leq$ 400 MeV, $-400 \leq K_{sym} \leq 100 $MeV, $-200 \leq J_{sym} \leq 800$ MeV, see, $e.g.$ , refs. \cite{Shlomo, Piekarewicz, Li 2, ZNB 2}. $K_{0}$, $E_{sym}(\rho_{0})$ and $L$ have already been constrained in a very narrow range, while $J_{0}$, $K_{sym}$ and $J_{sym}$ have large uncertainties. In this paper we choose $E_{sym}(\rho_{0})$ = 31.7 MeV and $L$ = 58.7 MeV. And the ranges of $J_{0}$, $K_{sym}$ and $J_{sym}$ we used is come from Li $et~ al$. \cite{YXLI}. More details about the the calculation of parametric EoS can be found in Ref. \cite{ZNB2018}. 
	
	
	
\section{Constraints on The EoS parameters}

Due to the low accuracy of damping time measurement. We first discuss that the NS have been detected by other observations and the mass of neutron star is already known. We use the potential f-mode frequency equal to 1.7kHz with 0.001kHz observation error and the mass is 1.4$M_\odot$ as input data. Then we 
 calculate the likelihood function $P(D|\mathcal{M})$,
\begin{equation}\label{EQ5}
	P(D|\mathcal{M}) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma_{obs,\nu}}exp[-\frac{(\nu_{th}-\nu_{obs})^2}{2\sigma^2_{obs}}]
\end{equation}
Where $\mathcal{M}$ represent the EoS with different parameters, $\nu_{th}$ is the theoretical f-mode frequency, $\nu_{obs}$ and $\sigma_{obs,\nu}$ are the observation f-mode frequency and error bar. Combining Eq. \ref{EQ1} and Eq. \ref{EQ5} we can get the probability distribution functions of the EoS parameters.

First, we got the constrain of symmetry energy $E_{sym}(\rho)$. The result is shown in Fig. 1. It is the inferred symmetry energy $E_{sym}(\rho)$ as functions of the reduced density $\rho/ \rho_0$. The black shadow represent prior distribution and the red represent $95\%$ credible interval(CI). It can be seen from the figure that $E_{sym}(\rho)$ is constrained tightly within their narrow bands, especially in the low-density part($\rho<3\rho_0$). In particular, the symmetry energy at $2\rho_0$ is determined to be $E_{sym}(2\rho_0) =48^{+2}_{-3} $.

\begin{figure}[H]\label{FIG1}
	
	\centering
	\includegraphics[height=8.0cm, width=10.0cm]{1.eps}
	\caption{Nuclear symmetry energy $E_{sym}(\rho)$ as a functions of the reduced density $\rho/\rho_0$. The black area represent prior and the red area represent $95\%$ credible interval.}
\end{figure}

For clearly, We show  the probability distribution functions of $E_{sym}(2\rho_0)$ varied from different f-mode GW signal  in the Fig.2(a). In this figure we found that with a fixed 1.4$M_\odot$ mass, the frequency of f-mode and $E_{sym}(\rho)$ have a certain correspondence. To make this correspondence more obvious, we show that the most proper $E_{sym}(2\rho_0)$ change with frequency in Fig.2(b). This result may be due to the negative correlation between $1.4M_\odot$ NS radii and symmetry energy. Since $f\propto \sqrt{M/R^3}$ and generally $M/R^3$ will decrease with the increase of $E_{sym}2(\rho_0)$. 

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\subfigure[distribution of $E_{sym}(2\rho_0)$ ]{\includegraphics[height=6.0cm, width = 8cm]{2a.eps}}
	\subfigure[most prober $E_{sym}(2\rho_0)$ ]{\includegraphics[height=6.0cm, width = 8cm]{2b.eps}}
	\caption{Constraints on the symmetric energy at 2 times the saturation density. PDF is show in (a) with different f-mode frequencies at M=$1.4 m_\odot $, (b) represent the most prober $E_{sym}(2\rho_0)$ change with frequency for M=$1.4 m_\odot$ . The observation error of f-MODE are all set as 0.001 kHz}
\end{figure}

It can be seen from Eq. \ref{EQ3} and Eq. \ref{EQ4} that $K_{sym}$, $J_{sym}$ and $J_0$ determine the properties of EoS. Especially, when the density is close to $\rho_0$, the parameter $K_{sym}$ represent the curvature and $J_{sym}$ represent skewness of nuclear symmetry energy, the  parameter $J_0$ represent skewness of symmetric nuclear matter but at high density region the parameters are very uncertain. We illustrate the distribution of $K_{sym}$, $J_{sym}$ and $J_0$ in Fig.3. 

%\begin{figure}[H] \label{FIG3}

%	\subfigure[  $K_{sym}$]{\includegraphics[height=6cm,width=8cm]{3a.eps}}

%\end{figure}
%Since the parameter $K_{sym}$ characterizing the property of symmetric energy in the low-density section, we can see that the parameter $K_{sym}$ can be well constrained like the symmetric energy, mainly because the average density of neutron stars with $1.4M_\odot$ is relatively low. For the parameter $J_{sym}$, because it mainly determines the high-density symmetry energy, it cannot be well constrained at $1.4M_\odot$. The parameter $J_{0}$ mainly characterizing the high-density behavior of the symmetric nuclear matter\cite{Zhang2018}.

In the following of this section, we will use the f-mode frequency and damping time to jointly constrain the parameters of the EoS. In fact use the f-mode frequency and damping time, the distribution of mass and radius of neutron stars can be obtained. However, the most important problem on neutron star is to obtain the relevant information about the EoS. Therefore, we only discuss the use of f-mode to constrain the EoS. In this part. The likelihood function we used are shown below,
\begin{equation}
	P(D|\mathcal{M}) = \frac{1}{2\pi\sigma_{obs,\nu}\sigma_{obs,\tau}}exp[-\frac{(\nu_{th}-\nu_{obs})^2}{2\sigma^2_{obs,\nu}}]exp[-\frac{(\tau_{th}-\tau_{obs})^2}{2\sigma^2_{obs,\tau}}]
\end{equation}
 Where $\tau_{th}$ represent theoretical damping time, $\tau_{obs}$ and $\sigma_{obs,\tau}$ are the observation damping time and the observation error.
 
 According to the results given by Kokkotas $et~ al$. \cite{Kok2001}, the observation error of damping time for f-mode is $\delta \tau/\tau =0.2$ . So we assume that the damping time is $0.22s$ and the observation error of the f-mode damping time is 0.02s. Because the observation accuracy of the damping time is low, the result obtained by using frequency and damping time is not as good as the result of using the combined constraint on frequency and mass. As shown in Fig.4, the distribution of $E_{sym}(2\rho_0)$ varies with f-mode frequency, the  $95\%$ confidence interval for the 2 times saturation density symmetric energy corresponding to frequency  $1.7\pm0.001kHz$ and damping time $0.22\pm0.02$  is $E_{sym}(2\rho_0) = 52^{+34}_{-8}$.

	\caption{The constraint of different f mode frequencies on the 2$\rho_0$ of neutron star with damping time $0.22\pm 0.02$. In the figure, we select the observation error of f-MODE as 0.001 kHz}
\end{figure}
%And we also got the distribution of  $K_{sym}$, $J_{sym}$ and $J_0$. Shown in Fig.5 . Similar to the previous results, the $K_{sym}$ parameter are relatively well constrained.

%\end{figure}
%According to D. H. Wen $et~ al.$\cite{Wen2010} there are universal relations between the f-mode frequencies and damping times for different stellar mass. Through these universal relations, we can know that when the damping time is fixed, the lower f-mode frequency corresponds to a larger NS mass, that is, a larger average density. Therefore, in fig. 5, the parameters $J_{sym}$, $J_0$ related to the properties of the high-density EoS can be better constrained only when the f-mode frequency is 1.6kHz.

\section{summary}
In this paper, we assume the f-mode GW signal have been observed. We use potential f-mode frequency and damping time constrain the symmetry energy $E_{sym}(\rho)$ and EoS parameters $K_{sym}$, $J_{sym}$ and $J_0$, we found that f-mode GW signal can effectively restrict the range of $E_{sym}(\rho)$. For example when NS mass is 1.4$M_\odot$, f-mode frequency is $1.7\pm 0.001kHz$, we can get the 2 times saturation density $E_{sym}(2\rho_0) = 48^{+2}_{-3}$ and  $K_{sym} = -130^{+90}_{-42}$. Should be noted that since the f-mode has not been observed so far, the results we give are only used to illustrate the possibility and accuracy of the f-mode constrained EoS. We anticipate the f-mode GW signals can be detected in the near future. With the realization of future observation and the increase of observation results, there will be more information as input to constrain the EoS. In fact these signals can be multi-faceted, such as the maximum mass of the neutron star, radius, rotational inertia, f-mode, and many others, use the Bayesian method we can integrate each observation together to constrain the EoS.
